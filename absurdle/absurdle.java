// P2: Absurdle
// TA: Abby & Connor
// This class allows the user to play the game Absurdle, a variation on Wordle. It takes in the
// length of the words that a user wants to guess and allows the user to continuously guess
// words, with the intention of prolonging the game for as long as possible. When the user 
// guesses the last word possible to guess given the clues the program has given them, the
// user wins and the game is over.
